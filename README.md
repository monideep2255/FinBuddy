OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Market Data API Configuration
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_api_key_here

# Database Configuration (automatically set by Replit)
# DATABASE_URL=
# PGUSER=
# PGHOST=
# PGPASSWORD=
# PGDATABASE=
# PGPORT=
```

### API Keys

#### OpenAI API Key

To use the content generation features, you need to:

1. Sign up for an OpenAI account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create an API key in your OpenAI dashboard
3. Add the API key to your `.env` file

If the OpenAI API key is not provided, the application will use fallback content instead of generating new explanations and quiz questions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Create the `.env` file with required environment variables
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the application: `npm run dev`
5. Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000

## Development Workflow
