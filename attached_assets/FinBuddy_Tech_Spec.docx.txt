🛠️ FinBuddy – Technical Specification
 Version: v1.0 (Initial Prototype for Replit Core / Bolt.new)
________________


📆 1. Application Overview
FinBuddy is an AI-powered financial education platform that helps users understand complex finance and economic concepts in simple, relatable terms. It delivers topic cards with real-world examples, interactive quizzes, and real-time market data using GPT-4 and finance APIs.
Users can explore topics like inflation, tariffs, bonds, and options, and see how current market conditions connect to these ideas. Over time, users can track progress, ask finance-related questions in a chat-style interface, and simulate market scenarios.

🤀 3. AI Prompt & Processing Flow
                              1. Topic Generation (Phase 1)

                                 * Use predefined prompts per topic for:

                                    * Simple explanation

                                    * Real-world analogy

                                    * Short quiz

                                    * Optional: summary feedback on user answers

                                       2. Real-time Q&A (Phase 3)

                                          * User inputs question (e.g., "What happens to bonds when inflation rises?")

                                          * Send prompt to GPT-4 with:

                                             * System role: financial educator

                                             * Style: simple, human-friendly, with examples

                                                3. Scenario Simulation (Phase 5)

                                                   * Use GPT to simulate expected effects from user-defined scenarios

                                                   * e.g., "Inflation hits 7% and interest rates stay flat"

🔬 4. Prompt Engineering Examples
Each topic card is backed by reusable GPT prompts:
                                                      * "Explain [concept] like I’m 12, using a real-life analogy."

                                                      * "Generate 3 quiz questions on [concept] with 1 correct and 2 distractor answers."

                                                      * "Correct this user misunderstanding about [concept] with a friendly explanation."

                                                      * "Simulate Buffett's view on [concept]."

                                                      * "Fit [economic event] into Ray Dalio's economic machine model."
