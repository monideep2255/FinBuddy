 Version: Initial Prototype

1. 🧚‍♂️ Background / Context
In a world where economic shifts like inflation, interest rates, bond yields, and tariffs impact our daily lives, most people remain confused about how these forces actually work. Advice like "buy the dip" or "watch treasury yields" is everywhere, yet few feel confident making financial decisions.
Educational resources are either too technical (e.g., Investopedia), too fragmented (e.g., YouTube), or too passive (e.g., textbooks). There's no interactive, example-driven system that breaks down financial and economic concepts in a way real people can understand and apply.
FinBuddy aims to change that. It’s a friendly, interactive finance learning tool that explains key concepts in simple language, shows real-life examples, and ties learning to live market data.
The tool also draws inspiration from the philosophies of legendary investors like Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio. These thinkers emphasize:
* The importance of understanding fundamentals (e.g., how businesses and economies actually work)

* Avoiding speculation and focusing on long-term thinking

* Having a clear understanding of risk vs reward

* Staying rational in emotional markets

* Learning how the economic machine works (Dalio)

"The most important investment you can make is in yourself." – Warren Buffett
"If you understand what the economy is and how it works, you can navigate it better." – Ray Dalio
FinBuddy incorporates these lessons into its learning model, helping users think like disciplined, well-informed investors.
